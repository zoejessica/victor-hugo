Hi, I'm ZoÃ« ðŸ‘‹.

I'm British but live in the Bahamas and Canada, which basically means I got so bored with drizzle I decided to build a life where the weather smacks you in the face every day before stealing your lunch.

When I'm not doing computer stuff, you can find me [lifting at the gym](https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/), taking photos, looking at contemporary art, hiking and baking.
