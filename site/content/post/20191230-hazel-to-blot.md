description: Hazel to Blot
---

Inspired by [@bsag](https://www.wingsopenwide.org.uk), Iâ€™ve set up a very minimal photo travel blog on [zoejessica.com](http://www.zoejessica.com). Iâ€™ve long been wanting to share more photos again (rip old school flickr), but without falling into Instagram by default. I donâ€™t *_mind_* insta per se, I actually love it for design inspiration and find it incredibly useful for bodybuilding tips, but Iâ€™m not so much about hashtagging and captioning and all that. I think I must have used up my patience for metadata-ing things back in the Limewire mp3 firehose days ðŸ˜¬.

Anyway. [Blot](blot.im) is a fantastic, light static site generator for just getting stuff online without fuss or ceremony, with really nice, minimal templates. It watches a folder in Dropbox (or git, if youâ€™re getting twitchy about Dropbox) and pushes whateverâ€™s in there to a domain of choice.  

The neat part is that Blot'll extract metadata encoded in filenames. This, in conjunction with [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com)â€™s folder actions, makes for a super-simple workflow:

Iâ€™ve set up Hazel to watch a `BlotBox` folder, using the [recursive rule](https://www.noodlesoft.com/manual/hazel/advanced-topics/processing-subfolders/) to apply a renaming action to any files in subfolders. When I export photos, I put them in a subfolder named for the tag I want to apply â€“ Iâ€™m using locations, so something like `BlotBox/Avignon` .  

![Hazel renaming action](/images/20191230/hazel-rule.png)

The renaming action (on the top level `BlotBox` folder) pulls the capture date (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format) using Hazel's specialized `date taken` variable , while the name of the source subfolder is applied as both tag (in `[]`) and name (see metadata exhaustion syndrome, above). So publishing becomes:

1. Export jpegs from Photos into a subfolder named for the tag
2. There is no step 2! Hazel runs the renaming action, moves the photos to `Dropbox/Apps/Blot` where Blot picks â€˜em up and publishes them.

So easy. So much more time freed up for theme tweaking ðŸ˜….
