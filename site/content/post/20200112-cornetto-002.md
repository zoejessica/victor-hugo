### code
I'm writing after a longer-than-expected winter break, and not gonna lie, my brain was basically applesauce until Wednesday. Over the holiday, I really shied away from anything complicated that felt too much like problem-solving, and I do feel rested. Couldn't resist some reading though:

[Combine: Asynchronous Programming with Swift](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/combine-asynchronous-programming-with-swift)
We use ReactiveSwift at work so the concepts aren‚Äôt new, and I‚Äôm sure I could have picked it all up from docs‚Ä¶ but it was honestly relaxing to read this and get a gentle introduction to the new apis. Panic averted.

A couple of just *nice* techniques here by John Sundell for [avoiding race conditions, implementing thread safety](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/avoiding-race-conditions-in-swift/) and [caching wrapping NSCache](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/caching-in-swift/): nothing complex, but the kind of patterns that I need to remind myself of every now and again, to not reinvent the wheel under pressure.

[Circles within circles: custom types and extensions ‚Äî Erica Sadun](https://ericasadun.com/2020/01/10/circles-within-circles-custom-types-and-extensions/)
Erica Sadun is brilliant as always but add *spirographs* to the mix and I‚Äôm sold. (I‚Äôd love to implement this in SwiftUI.) üòª

### lift
One of my resolutions/goals/aspirations/whathaveyous for 2020 is to get a really strong core, mostly because I am over-competitive and my husband has a seemingly effortless hollow hold. It‚Äôs not effortless of course, he can do it because he practices in an annoyingly consistent way, whereas I give up after 15 seconds because ‚Äúit hurts‚Äù. [This is a good listicle of effective core moves](https://www.self.com/gallery/core-exercises-top-trainers-swear-by) that don‚Äôt make me want to die quite as much as hollow holds - this month, every time I do a weights workout, I‚Äôm picking 3 of these, and doing 3 sets of each.

### bake
#### Buckwheat-vanilla elephant biscuits
Original recipe: [I Pasticci dello Ziopiero: Il Tuffo del Saraceno](http://ipasticcidelloziopiero.blogspot.com/2012/01/il-tuffo-del-saraceno.html)

![Elephant shaped biscuits](/images/20200112/biscuits.jpg)

We‚Äôve been eating these for breakfast for years - they‚Äôre my dad‚Äôs favourite when he comes to stay. Dunking recommended. If you read Italian, the blog linked is a good source for recipes.

* 190g flour (AP or cake, or spelt, or wholewheat pastry, or a mix)
* 120g potato starch or rice flour, cornstarch in a pinch, something low gluten
* 100g buckwheat flour
* 140g light brown sugar
* 130g butter
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 tsp baking powder
* pinch salt
* vanilla - seeds from 1 pod or 1tsp essence
* a little milk (50g?) to make dough

for the glaze:
* splash milk, pinch salt and an egg beaten together
* demerara/turbinado sugar

cream butter & sugar. add in all other ingredients and enough milk to bring it all together. pat out into a flat disc, cover with clingfilm, chill for 1 hour. meanwhile heat oven to 200¬∫C. roll out, cut into shapes, brush with the glaze and sprinkle generously with demerara sugar. I roll them pretty thick so they take about 20-25 mins for a good, browned bake.
