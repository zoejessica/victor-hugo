description:Whatâ€™s in my bag: long-haul, long-stay edition
---

Much as the phrase makes me throw up in my mouth a little, I suppose I qualify as a part-time digital nomad at this point: I [work](https://www.stopwatch.com) while traveling, but mostly for extended stays of up to 3 months in one place. Enough time to get to know a city and _really_ miss the stuff I forgot. This is my essentials kit.

### Parmesan grater
I married an Italian: pasta is religion, life, constant. We do not move without one of these. Tried many brands (paging [@siracusa](https://twitter.com/siracusa) but [the Zyliss](https://www.amazon.com/ZYLISS-Classic-Rotary-Cheese-Grater/dp/B00MGLOW8C/ref=sxin_5_osp20-99cadcf6_cov?ascsubtag=99cadcf6-5c07-4dd7-9278-c5910ee64189&creativeASIN=B01HX6HAK6&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osp.99cadcf6-5c07-4dd7-9278-c5910ee64189&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-search&keywords=zyliss%2Bcheese%2Bgrater&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B01HX6HAK6&pd_rd_r=95c90c1b-fe77-4e9d-8bcb-cc8bd04ada5c&pd_rd_w=DG8XC&pd_rd_wg=Ia9dD&pf_rd_p=e1262d27-368d-44f1-a337-220e1af8b014&pf_rd_r=JFH2QQXXZRBV78BW4TSV&qid=1577464963&tag=bestcont06-20&th=1) is light, durable, goes in the dishwasher and is inexpensive enough to forget (_every flippin' time_).

### Ikea food clips
Airbnbs never have enough tupperware, and [these](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/bevara-sealing-clip-set-of-30-assorted-colors-mixed-colors-mixed-sizes-assorted-sizes-10339171/) are so much better than buying plastic bags or clingfilm.

### Cucumber eye gel patches
Eye bags and dark circles arenâ€™t really one of my beauty concerns. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I *have* concerns for sure - I live in the Bahamas and have resigned myself to turning into a Sharpei sooner rather than later - but the undereye area generally does alright. However, two factors make them swell and puff like nobodyâ€™s business: jet-lag and altitude. [These patches](https://www.sephora.com/product/cucumber-de-tox-hydra-gel-eye-patches-P412025) actually work, include a little spatula to get them out, and survive being tossed around in a suitcase.

### Wipes
The most bougie ones I have are these [Yuni shower sheets](https://www.sephora.com/product/shower-sheets-large-body-wipes-P415782?skuId=1922020&keyword=YUNI%20-%20SHOWER%20SHEETS%20Large%20Body%20Wipes) but the basic red Wet Wipes do an excellent job too - actually wet and donâ€™t dry out the skin. Heaven in a tent, but pretty great when flying too.

### Rinazina
This is a [decongestant nasal spray](http://www.rinazina.it/medicinali/rinazina_spray_nasale.html), and itâ€™s the most effective product in the world. Two sprays of this and not only are you back to breathing normally, but you are also *suspiciously* energetic. As far as I know itâ€™s only available in Italy, over the counter, no prescription necessary. Itâ€™s probably highly addictive or toxic or both, but there would be a national outcry if they banned it. I have a stash because colds are unbearable without.

### Barbell locking clips
Wherever I am, I get my lift in. I do like a barbell, but my weakling wrists canâ€™t deal with those metal spring clips. If itâ€™s that hard to change up the plates I tend to skimp on warmup sets or avoid scaling back if the weight is a bit punchy, neither of which is a smart idea. Now I always travel with [these clips](https://www.amazon.com/Lock-Jaw-50mm-Olympic-Barbell-Collar/dp/B01FH1IH5G?ref_=ast_bbp_dp&th=1&psc=1), which make even the most neglected and rusty bar feel better. Bonus: [Lululemon yoga towels](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/womens-gifts-for-yogis/The-Towel/_/prod1410047?color=38129&sz=ONESIZE) are great for the gym when travelling, as theyâ€™re light but big enough to cover the grossest of machines (nothing like using the pec deck machine for reverse flyes, with your face pressed into someone elseâ€™s back sweat ðŸ‘Œ).

### Slippers
I do not understand the appeal of those slippers that just cover the forefoot, leaving the ankle and heel to hang out behind, abandoned in the frigid air. [The short classic Uggs](https://www.ugg.com/women-boots-classic-boots/classic-mini-ii-boot/1016222.html?dwvar_1016222_color=CHO#start=11&cgid=women-boots-classic-boots) keep it *all* warm even when wearing cropped sweats, are surprisingly light and squishable for packing, and you can take out the trash in them. As a person who becomes unbearable when operated outside a very limited temperature range, these are essential. Bonus: [Falke Striggings](https://www.falke.com/uk_en/striggings-rib-women-socks-green-971-7647) socks - cozy af, but actually survive washing and the dryer, unlike cashmere.

### Laptop Stand
I saw someone use [this lightweight stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HHYQBB8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on Twitter (no idea who at this point but ðŸ‘‹ and thanks!) and insta-bought it. It seems a bit spindly, but itâ€™s turned out to be remarkably durable and folds up small and light. My work travel set up is my MBP, Sony WH1000XM3s, the stand, a Magic Trackpad and this [bluetooth split keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Freestyle2-Wireless-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Separation/dp/B00NMVJYEW/ref=sr_1_3?crid=12VMBK8T5YIQE&keywords=kinesis+freestyle2&qid=1577467036&s=electronics&sprefix=kinesis+f%2Celectronics%2C182&sr=1-3).
